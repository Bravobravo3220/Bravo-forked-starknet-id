# Starknet.id Contract

This contract is written in Cairo. It allows to mint identity nfts.
The nft contains fields associated with values. For each field, there can be a user value or values certified by other contracts. In some cases there can be both.

## Usage

### For users
```cairo
# mint a nft with id token_id (can be random, must not be already minted)
mint(token_id)

# write a data (my discord id) associated to a token_id of a NFT I own and a type (here the felt 'discord')
set_user_data(token_id, 'discord', 707979046952239197)
```

### For verifiers
```cairo
# confirm this data is correct for this specific type and token_id (e.g. you got a proof)
set_verifier_data(token_id, 'discord', 707979046952239197)
```

### For external services
```cairo
# get data written by the nft owner
get_user_data(token_id, 'discord')

# get data written by the specified verifier
get_verifier_data(token_id, 'discord', verifier_addr)

# get data only if both verifier and owner agreed on its value
get_confirmed_data(token_id, 'discord', verifier_addr)
```
